First, I'd like to personally thank you for taking a look at my program =)

Second, I'd like to warn you that as it stands, this program requires an IDE to run. However, adjustments shouldn't be too hard to make.

Third, I'd like to publically express the purpose of this program. While it may not seem special upon an initial look over, this project has been extremely important to my development as a programmer and has even led me to discover what I want to do with my life. 

Initially, I created this project as just a simple addition program that I could use to practice what I learned and ran in a single class. Then, I added subtraction, multiplication, and division and had one large class running in slow if statements. 

After that, I learned about ```switch``` commands. I used these to speed up the code. My next step was learning how to separate the code into separate classes which were much smaller and easier to work with.

Next, I figured out that if I used a variable, which I labeled ```forgive```, and a ```while``` loop, I could make it so that if an input did not exactly match one of the possible cases, it wouldn't end the run but instead loop back. 

After this, I decided to extend the capabilities of my program and added metric/imperial conversions. I then decided that was not enough and added [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)) calculations. Still, for some reason, I have decided to add (and depending on the time you see this, I am still working on) added [Stoichiometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)) to the program. Meanwhile, I also figured out how to organize the classes into separate packages/folders and still access them from other classes outside of those packages using ```import <LOCATION>.<CLASSNAME>;```.

This process has led me to solidify what I have learned about Java and has even led me to desire a career in software/game development. I also have found the desire to learn cybersecurity, both offensive and maybe defensive. Before starting this project, I never thought that I would like programming as much as I do, and think that this project has helped me discover more about myself and my capabilities, I now desire to learn other major languages, such as Python, C++, and C#. It is for this reason that I HIGHLY suggest all learners come up with a simple concept they can create and expand on as their knowledge of the language they are learning grows.
